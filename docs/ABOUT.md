# About Fashion Insights

Fashion Insights is created by me, **Ortal**.

I'm a data scientist, vibe coder and vibe solver who loves turning creator signals into simple, useful insights about what's trending in fashion and culture. I use data, AI and intuition to uncover patterns that feel real and make sense.

This project started as a way to explore how we can use public social signals to understand fashion trends in real-time—without the noise, without the gatekeeping, just clean insights delivered to your inbox every week.

## The Approach

I believe in:
- **Data with intuition** – Numbers tell a story, but context makes it real
- **Respecting creators** – We analyze public trends, never re-host content, always attribute
- **Simplicity** – Cut through the noise, deliver what matters
- **Transparency** – Open about methods, honest about limitations

## What This Platform Does

Fashion Insights analyzes publicly available fashion content to identify:
- Emerging trends before they go mainstream
- Product recommendations from real influencers
- Coupon codes and deals shared by creators
- Color palettes, styles, and brands gaining momentum

All delivered weekly via a clean, minimal newsletter—and optionally, as an audio summary you can listen to.

## The Tech Stack

Built with:
- **n8n** for workflow automation
- **OpenAI** for trend analysis
- **Google Sheets** for subscriber management
- **Mailjet** for email delivery
- **ElevenLabs** for voice AI (optional)
- **Lovable** for the frontend experience

Everything is designed with legal safety in mind: we never re-host influencer images, store raw captions, or claim endorsements. Just clean data extraction, AI analysis, and proper attribution.

## Who This Is For

- **Fashion enthusiasts** who want to stay ahead of trends
- **Content creators** looking for inspiration and validation
- **Brands** researching what's resonating right now
- **Data nerds** (like me) who find patterns fascinating
